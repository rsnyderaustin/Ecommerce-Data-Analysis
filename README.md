# Project Description
The purpose of this project is to display my skills in answering business questions through SQL query writing and data visualizations. The dataset originates from the Brazilian e-commerce company Olist, and is made publicly available through the website Kaggle. For hosting, managing, and querying the dataset, I hosted a PostgreSQL server on my local machine, and managed the database with a mix of the command line tool 'psql' and software DBeaver.

# Business Questions and Analysis
## Sales Representatives (SR) Performance Analysis
### What is the total revenue generated by business category, broken down by sales representative?
```
SELECT sitn.first_name AS sales_rep_first_name, 
	sitn.last_name as sales_rep_last_name, cd.business_segment, SUM(oi.price) AS total_revenue
FROM order_items oi
LEFT JOIN closed_deals cd
	ON oi.seller_id = cd.seller_id
INNER JOIN sales_id_to_name sitn
	ON cd.sr_id = sitn.sales_id
GROUP BY sitn.first_name, sitn.last_name, cd.business_segment
```
### For every month, who are our top three sales representatives by number of closed deals?
```
WITH qualified_leads_y_m AS (
	SELECT mql_id, TO_CHAR(TO_DATE(ql.first_contact_date, 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS'), 'YYYY-MM') as first_contact_date
	FROM qualified_leads ql 
),
sr_ranks as (
SELECT ql.first_contact_date,
	RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY ql.first_contact_date 
		ORDER BY COUNT(cd.sr_id) DESC) as rank,
	COUNT(cd.sr_id) as sr_number_of_closes,
	sitn.first_name, sitn.last_name
FROM qualified_leads_y_m ql 
INNER JOIN closed_deals cd
	ON ql.mql_id = cd.mql_id
INNER JOIN sales_id_to_name sitn
	ON cd.sr_id = sitn.sales_id
GROUP BY ql.first_contact_date, sitn.first_name, sitn.last_name
)
SELECT *
FROM sr_ranks sr
WHERE rank IN (1, 2, 3)
ORDER BY first_contact_date DESC, rank ASC
```
### What is the revenue generated and average revenue per deal for every month and year broken down by sales representative?

For example, a total revenue of $100,000 in year-month 2018-01 for sales person 'Roger Smith' means that 'Roger Smith' closed deals with sellers in year-month 2018-01 that have since sold $100,000 worth of product through the e-commerce site.
```
WITH seller_revenue_and_won_date as (
-- Find the total revenue for each seller
	SELECT 
		cd.seller_id,
		SUM(oi.price) as total_revenue
	FROM order_items oi
	INNER JOIN closed_deals cd
		ON oi.seller_id = cd.seller_id
	GROUP BY cd.seller_id
)
SELECT sales_name.first_name, sales_name.last_name, cd.won_date, COUNT(cd.sr_id) as closed_deals, 
SUM(srwd.total_revenue) AS total_revenue
FROM closed_deals cd
INNER JOIN seller_revenue_and_won_date srwd
	ON cd.seller_id = srwd.seller_id
INNER JOIN sales_id_to_name sales_name
	ON cd.sr_id = sales_name.sales_id
GROUP BY sales_name.first_name, sales_name.last_name, cd.won_date
ORDER BY sales_name.last_name DESC, cd.won_date ASC
```
# Database Setup Notes
### Customer Id Key Oddity
One oddity to note is the relationship of 'customer_id' and 'customer_unique_id' in the customers table shown specifically below. 

![odd_olist_relationship](https://github.com/rsnyderaustin/Ecommerce-Data-Analysis/assets/114520816/7624d5ce-1d73-4a10-8588-a1a08f721406)

In the 'orders' table, both a unique order_id and a unique customer_id are generated for each order, rather than using 'customer_id' as a foreign key relating to the 'customers' table. So, in the 'customers' table, there can be many 'customer_id's for each primary key 'customer_unique_id'. The implication of this relationship is that to analyze data based on individual customer data, the 'customer_id' column of any table has to be joined with and replaced by 'customer_unique_id'. This normally will just add a subquery or CTE.

### Determining Key Relationships
To determine one-to-one, many-to-one, etc relationships, queries such as the one below can display whether a table has multiple instances of a foreign key for the key relationship that we're interested in.
```
SELECT o.order_id AS primary_key, COUNT(r.order_id) AS num_foriegn_keys
FROM orders o
INNER JOIN order_reviews r
	ON o.order_id = r.order_id
GROUP BY o.order_id 
HAVING COUNT(r.order_id) > 1
LIMIT 5
```

### Translate Product Category Names from Spanish to English
The original dataset has a separatable table for translating the Spanish 'product_category_name' in the 'products' table to English. The query below joins the two tables, replacing the Spanish 'product_category_name' column with the English translations. The resulting table then replaces the original 'products' table.
```
SELECT distinct p.product_id, pcnt.product_category_name_english, p.product_photos_qty, p.product_weight_g,
p.product_length_cm, p.product_height_cm, p.product_width_cm
FROM public.product_category_name_translation pcnt 
INNER JOIN public.products p
	ON
